 In the oldest event, there was no word for church. Because of the whole testament, there was the word tabaneko. The tabaneko was representing a temple structure, which was more like a miniature model of what God was intended to do with Israel. So the tabaneko was a temple around the dwelling place, but yet it was called the tabanek of the witness, Vishikina, the glory of God, recited in the tabaneko of Moses. And yes, the nature of Israelites, out of rebellion, the years later, the Israelites went into different wars and they moved from tabaneko, and God had to raise days and gave David a vision to build a house for God. And when David was about to do what he felt the Lord leading him to. He says, now not to build the Lord a house and the Lord says, David, you're not going to build a house for me because your hands are full of blood. Your hands are full of blood of the walls, of the feastsigns that characterise the gypsy signs, but above all you have in your hands the blood of your ear. But this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to raise your son. One is going to come from your own ears. It is going to build a house. And so on. And so on and build the temple of Solomon, the grandeur and the majesty and the expertise of the architectural skill of the progress that Solomon displayed in building the temple is way beyond our season and way beyond our need. Solomon, who is great of the richest men up to date because of his wealth, built a temple, but because of the various and disobedience and this honour, God moved on to destroy the temple. And here to lead these people into captivity and into exile. And when the mood to battle on God began to, because of the need to congregate and pray and praise the Lord, these are nice, then established temple structures which will now all the synchons. So it is in Babylon where we see the emergence of the Pharisees, the sepies, the priests and the scribes. And the synchon became the most significant type of worship up until the Lord had to build the temple of Israel, which was a little destroyed. I'm in the temple. I'm here in the church. So you read the observant, he told us and then there was no word for church. The Swiss time the word church came became when Jesus was at Caesar the Epid and he says, who do you men say that I have? What do you men say that I am? Some say, do you admire Elias or do you admire Elijah or Isaiah or one of the prophets? So he says, what do you say that I am? And Peter replies that you are the Christ, the Christos, the Son of the living God. And he says, blessed are you, Son of the Father, Jonah, because flesh and blood there has not revealed this unto you. But by Father which is in heaven and Peter I say unto you, upon this walk I will build my church. He will say, church. And from the word church, he will start reading Greek. That's why we have the word Ekkisia. Because Ekkisia is the combination of two words or two prefixes, which is Ekk and Kisia. Ekk simply means exit. Ekkisia means enter. So church is a place where you exit from something and you enter into something. So even count for these church servers, you have to exit from certain places and you have to enter into certain dimensions. Or maybe something. And I am here to clear and look at about the whole spirit. May you exit out of depression and may you enter into a season of joy in Jesus day. May you break out of anxiety and move into a season of undisturbed peace. A peace that surpasses all understanding. May you exit out of the season of the leg and enter into the season where you need supplies all your needs according to the riches in glory. Shekimim is in my supply. I have a church. I have a church. I have a church. I have a church. I have a church. So this is where we have the word church. But church, Jesus spoke the word church in Paul is only tense. And as I promised the other tense, he said he means he was promising a church to come. Because the gospels, from Matthew, Mark, Luke to John, it is never a new testament. The Bible is the New Testament. It was not a new testament. It was the climax of the Old Testament. Jesus came as the cherry on top. He came to finish and close the Old Testament chapter. So whenever Jesus steps into your life, he is coming to close certain chapters. And immediately he could be by the power of the Holy Spirit. May the same Jesus who touched the men at the center change your life and change your season. May the same Jesus who commanded Jairus daughter to leave the country change your life. Before July comes to an end, in the next two weeks I've talked about a joint visitation in your life. And I don't care if you are leaving it or not, but we are sending angels to your house. Sending angels to your pecker count. Saving angels to those. Starbone, better, starbone people who are over here. God has to send angels to starbone destiny helpers who are not responding in time to cheat your season. And I think we as Caesar, where we invoke angelic activity, are here in the Church. And we are standing here at the Lager whose name is Jesus. And this is the same Lager that Jacob saw in the Old Testament. And he saw angels are sent and descended. If demons are real, angels are also real. And I need you to shift your mind from demonic consciousness to angelic consciousness. You need not to begin to be our way, but if they are devils of witchcraft. There is also angel of Michael who is going to come to fight your battles and come to your rescue. And my man says, Am I talking to people in the Church? Shut my angel is being activated. Oh, she said, my angel is being activated. And this evening my assignment is very simple. I'm here to inform angelic activity. There are some angels that have been unemployed, sitting on bridges doing nothing. But they need to be activated to move from your behalf. A range of water and diseases would disappear. How much more we are in the Old Testament with better promises, better high-pist. It means better things are coming. Can I speak to someone in their Church? Am I talking to people in their Church? Your pain was preparation for whatever God is about to bring. The deeper the pain, the intense the pain, the greater the joy that is coming. And Amiki says, this tense the lip of pain, the intense the grace of God that is going to come over your life. Of course, this moment is my presence suffering. Can not be compared to the future glory that shall be revealed. Glory is revealed. And anything that is revealed is something that is needed. Your colleagues and your friends, they don't even know what you carry. They don't even know what God is put upon your table. They don't even know what your name can invoke. They don't even know the properties that are like and connected to your name. Am I talking to people in their Church? But we need to make a declaration and command the evidence of our faith. And this week I wanted to pray one prayer and say, God, I know you exist and you are real. But I need evidence of my faith. I need evidence of my faith. Because the enemy is fighting me, left, right and center. And I am blessed from every side. But I need you to give me evidence. Check it out. I need my talking delivery. The truth is the Lord. I need to be a sony, strategic system, Church. And the Church manifested in acts, chartered to, and the Bible says, and the Holy Spirit came in the form of the mighty Jesus. And the mighty Russian wind. And the Russian wind filled the house where they were in the city. Can I speak to someone in their Church? I said, and I don't give you their Church. Before God touches you, He has to first touch the house in which you are serving. Because the Bible says the wind before it touched their lips. It filled the house in which they were in. So as you are connected to a second house, there is already a way to blow it. If it is not attached to it, it doesn't mean that the wind of the Spirit is not there. It has to first feel the house. And then it fills the ones who are sitting. I imagine that the disciples were not standing in the city. Because God touches the person who understands the submission. And God is going to pursue, you need to sit down and learn. You need to sit down and master certain principles. You need to sit down and get information and revelation. I said, I hear you, I hear you, Church. And the Bible says, after preaching 3000, we added to the Church. And they continued in the apostles' doctrine. Silly, written bread.
